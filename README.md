# 🔐 Basic Text Encoder and Decoder (Java) & Java To-Do List Application
## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple Java-based Caesar Cipher implementation that allows users to encode and decode messages using a shift-based cipher.
It demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and modular programming in Java.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Encode a message with a user-defined shift.

✅ Decode a message back to its original form.

✅ Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.

✅ Keeps non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation) unchanged.

✅ Supports wrap-around (e.g., shifting Z with +2 → B).

✅ Menu-driven interface for easy user interaction.

✅ Input validation and clean modular code structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 8+ recommended)

Scanner class for user input

StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation

# Java To-Do List Application

## A simple **console-based To-Do List application** written in **Java**.  
This project allows users to **add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks**.  
It uses **UTF-8 encoding** so that completed tasks can be displayed with a ✔ (tick mark).

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ Add new tasks  
- 📋 View all tasks  
- ✔ Mark tasks as completed  
- ❌ Delete tasks  
- 💾 Saves tasks in memory (can be extended to use file/database storage)  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java (JDK 8 or later)**
- Console-based (No external libraries)
